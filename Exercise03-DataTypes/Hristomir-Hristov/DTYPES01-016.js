Print the numbers from the following list: 1, 10, 38, 4, 824, 120, 999, 64 in one
column, right justified. Pad all the digits with zeros so that the column is right-justified,
and the width is exactly the width of the longest number written in the list. The length of
a number is measured by the number of digits involved in its writing.

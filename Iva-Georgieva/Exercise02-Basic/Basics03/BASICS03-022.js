/* You have the following excerpt of a JavaScript code:
Try to calculate the value of the result variable, without executing the code 

let a = 1;
let b = 3;
let result = a ** ++b/b++**a;


- > a ** ++b = 1 ** 4 (prefix increment)  
- > b++ ** a = 4 ( current value is 4; postfix increment - > still 4) ** 1  
- > we have let result = 1 ** 4 / 4 ** 1

//Imagine you're solving a math problem. Declare ten variables, which you might need in your program
    
//In this excercise we'll declare the variables for each side of regular n-sided polygon and we'll calculate the permimeter and area


let s = 4.6; // size of the side of the n-sided polygon

let n = 12; // number of sides of the n-sided polygon

let r = 3.5; // radius or apothem of the regular polygon

let P = n * s; // P holds the value of the perimeter of the regular polygon

//console.log("The perimeter of the n-sided polygon is: " + P); //print the perimeter

let A = 1/2*n*s*r // formula for the area of the n-sided polygon, where A holds the value of the area

//console.log("The area of the n-sided polygon is: " + A);
 
let x ; // interior angle

let y; //exterior angle

let pi = 3.1415926535898;

let R; // circumradius

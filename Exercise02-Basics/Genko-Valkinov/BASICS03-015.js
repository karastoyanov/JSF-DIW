// BASICS03-015: Declare a variable. Assign one digit from the range of [1;9]. Print on the 
// console the multiplication table with that variable, but in reverse order – first print the 
// multiplication with 10, then with 9, etc. Also, print on each line the calculated result 
// from the multiplication raised to the second power (на степен 2).

//Declare a variable. Assign it with a letter from the English alphabet. Define a 
//constant, named Cipher and assign it a value in the range of [3;13]. Print on the console 
//the Cipher-th letter after the assigned letter to the variable. Imagine that the English 
//alphabet is linked in a circle (cycle) â€“ after Z letter follows A letter, then B etc. Example: 
//if you have Cipher=4, and the given letter is 'Y', then print on the console 'C' (the fourth
//after 'Y'). 

let letter = 'Y';
const Cipher = 4;
let code = letter.charCodeAt(0);

let newCode = (code >= 65 && code <= 90) ? ((code - 65 + Cipher) % 26 + 65) :
              (code >= 97 && code <= 122) ? ((code - 97 + Cipher) % 26 + 97) :
              code;

let newLetter = String.fromCharCode(newCode);

console.log(newLetter);

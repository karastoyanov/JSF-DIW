//Declare two variables. Assign them with two English alphabet characters –
//one in capital and the other one in lowercase. Compare them with the “lower than” 
//operator (<) and print on the console the result. Can you describe the result?

let letter1 = `B`;
let letter2 = `b`;

console.log(letter1 < letter2) // the result is true due to the position of both letters in the UNICODE ranking

Declare a variable. Assign it with a letter from the English alphabet.
Define a constant, named Cipher and assign it a value in the range of [3;13].
Print on the console the Cipher-th letter after the assigned letter to the variable.
Imagine that the English alphabet is linked in a circle (cycle) â€“ after Z letter follows A letter, then B etc.
Example:
If you have Cipher=4, and the given letter is 'Y', then print on the console 'C' (the fourth after 'Y'). 
*/

let letter = 'Y';
const Cipher = 4;

let newPosition = (letter.charCodeAt(0) - 'A'.charCodeAt(0) + Cipher) % 26;

let resultLetter = String.fromCharCode('A'.charCodeAt(0) + newPosition);

console.log(resultLetter);

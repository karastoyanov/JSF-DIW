BASICS02-015: Declare a variable. Assign it with a letter from the English alphabet. Define a
constant, named Cipher and assign it a value in the range of [3;13]. Print on the console
the Cipher-th letter after the assigned letter to the variable. Imagine that the English

alphabet is linked in a circle (cycle) â€“ after Z letter follows A letter, then B etc. Example:
if you have Cipher=4, and the given letter is 'Y', then print on the console 'C' (the fourth
after 'Y').

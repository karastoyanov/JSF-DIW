// Declare two variables. Assign them with one English alphabet character and one number character. 
// Compare them with the “greater than” operator (>) and print on the console the result. Can you describe the result?

let char = "A";
let num = 3;

console.log(char > num);

// When we compare the string "A" with the number 3, "A" cannot be converted to a number (it's NaN - Not a Number). 
// So, the result is alway false.

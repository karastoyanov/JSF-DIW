// Declare two variables. Assign them with two English alphabet characters –
// one in capital and the other one in lowercase. Compare them with the “lower than”
// operator (<) and print on the console the result. Can you describe the result?

let upperCase = "D";

console.log(upperCase < lowerCase);

// The Unicode value of the character 'D' is less than the Unicode value of the character 'e'. 
// This is because the Unicode value of 'D' is numerically lower than the Unicode value of 'e'.

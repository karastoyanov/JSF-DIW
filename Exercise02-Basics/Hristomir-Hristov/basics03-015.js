/*

Declare a variable. Assign one digit from the range of [1;9]. Print on the
console the multiplication table with that variable, but in reverse order â€“ first print the
multiplication with 10, then with 9, etc. Also, print on each line the calculated result from
the multiplication raised to the second power.

Are there any not correctly defined expressions in the following excerpt? If
any â€“ which one(s)? Why?
let a = 1;
let b = a;
let r1 = a+--b;
let r2 = a+++b;
let r3 = a---b;
let r4 = a-++b;
let r5 = a*++b;
let r6 = a*--b;
let r7 = a**++b*b;
let r8 = a**++b //b;

*/
      

/* r8 - if the intention here was to divide by b, then the expression is incorrect, since the first / negates the division. 
If the // was intended as a comment, then this one is correct as well. */
